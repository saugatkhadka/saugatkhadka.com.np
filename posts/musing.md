*Mar 8, 2020*

Before I made, or rather forked this blog, I was really into Jekyll, mostly fueled by my curiosity for Ruby more than four years ago. Since then, I've used Hugo, Gatsby, Tumblr (at some point), Wordpress even, to write my thoughts to the wonderful people of the internet. 

And most of those sites, repos and contents have been lost to my endless curiosity and bling bling of newer shinier tech, being replaced, displaced and forgotten over the years. I hope or rather wish most dearly that this blog finally survives the flood of newer stuff over the years.

After some easy convincing from the experiences of some really good people on twitter, I've decided to write my blog on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). And from what I can see, this experience is going to be a delight like no other.
