☝️ A blog has many components or so it has been made out to be. But does it need that many? I think not at least. Maybe. 😋 Alright I'm not sure 😅.

I've recently started my blog with eleventy, 🥳 a NodeJS based static site generator that looks to be pretty nice.  But Gatsby and others still lure me with their fancy stuff and React of course. Blazing fast sites have their pull, a draw to the ✨ shiny ✨ . Hoard needs it. *Ahem*. 

But it's quite sad that I don't have as much time as I used to, to explore each option and decide on one after trying them out. No, 😅 I just dove in and decided I would use this. And now I feel that might have not been a very good choice. But we should come to terms with our choices and decisions in life, though they might be of impulse or well-regarded examination. 😉

So I decided to slowly make my own stuff. A blog engine. Maybe. Since I have less time than ever, this choice makes less sense, but until I can get a good idea of how hard of a job I've handed down to myself 👌, I will just continue along with eleventy and this simple site. Though a touch there and a fix there might be due. 

And since I AM a Ruby developer, o(´д｀o) I will start working there. This nice language has a slow and relaxing pace and the community 🥰 seems to always be in slow but stable development. I find it a quite refreshing change to the one framework every other week of the Javascript world. Although I remain quite interested, making something to last you long time takes something more than just hype, it needs stability and a very strong will to resist the newest fad on the market. I for one, humbly accept 🙇 my weakness on that front and just decided to run away 🏃‍♂️ from anything close. So, Ruby. 😁

Anyways, let's see where this endeavor ends up.  🖖
