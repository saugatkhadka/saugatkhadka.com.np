I am a Rails developer at **Gurzu Inc**, Kathmandu, Nepal. I write Rails applications and ruby code for living, and I love a lot of it. 

A recent **Mobile Legends** player and obsessed hoarder of nice nice links. My preciousss.

I can admire a decent collection of anything really. And I really like to collect links and resource from all over the internet. It's a weird hobby I've recently come to terms with.
