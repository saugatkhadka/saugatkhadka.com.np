Hello. I am Saugat Khadka. A Rails developer at **[Gurzu Inc](https://gurzu.com)**, formerly **[Jyaasa](http://jyaasa.com) Pvt. Ltd.**, Kathmandu, Nepal. I mainly write Rails backend and sometimes begrudgingly front end code on slim. \**shudder*\*

Writing Rails applications and Ruby code for living, I've come to love a lot of it.

A recent **Mobile Legends** player and obsessed hoarder of nice nice links. My preciousss.

I can admire a decent collection of anything really. And I really like to collect links and resources from all over the internet. It's a weird hobby I've recently come to terms with. 

...

*Want to get to know me? <a href = "mailto:hello.saugatkhadka@gmail.com">Email</a> me. I'd be more than happy to hear from you.* ðŸ˜‰
